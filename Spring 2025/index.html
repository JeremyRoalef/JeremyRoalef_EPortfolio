			<p1>
				SharpShooter is the final video game created in the GameDev.tv course for Unity 3D. The video game is a bullet hell first-person shooter where your 
				objective is to destroy all the enemies before becoming overwhelmed by enemies or running out of bullets. The video game is a perfect template to 
				experiment with virtual reality (VR) concepts, immersing the player into the world with vr. Below are the modifications that we will attempt to complete 
				in SharpShooter VR: 				
			</p1>
		
			<ul>
				<!--First Point-->
				<li>Full transition from first-person shooter to a virtual reality video game</li>
				<!--Sub-points-->
				<ul>
					<li>Add in VR necessities (XR Interaction Toolkit, Meta XR Developmental Tools, etc.) </li>
					<li>Transition weapon shooting from a stationary weapon into a weapon that tracks the playerâ€™s hand movement </li>
					<li>Introduction to locomotion systems</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Simple joystick movement</li>
						<li>Grab controls</li>
						<li>Teleportation areas</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				
				<!--Second Point-->
				<li>Modify world with interactable mechanics. This includes adding interactable mechanics that was covered in CITA 314 and new interactive mechanics.</li>
				<!--Sub-points-->
				<ul>
					<li>Interactive hinges for doors, drawers, etc. </li>
					<li>Grab interactions with objects like ammunation clips, ladders, and simple props. </li>
					<li>UI controls for menu swapping, scene loading, and weapon transitions </li>
					<li>Other interactable mechanics we deem fit for SharpShooter VR </li>
				</ul>
				
				<!--Third Point-->
				<li>Introduce haptic feedback & adaptive music/SFX. </li>
				
				<!--Fourth Point-->				
				<li>Update/Balance the base SharpShooter video game for an enjoyable experience.</li>
				<!--Sub-points-->
				<ul>
				<li>Update how enemy spawning and attacking works in VR to make the experience intuitive and fair </li>
				<li>Introduce new means of gathering ammunition for the game to introduce new levels of immersion </li>
				<li> Add new content for player engagement
					<ul>
						<li>New enemies to fight </li>
						<li>New weapons to handle </li>
						<li>Additional gameplay mechanics </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

				Implementing VR concepts into SharpShooter VR proved challenging at first. To start, setting up the VR fundamentals was difficult. Since VR technology
				is still in its infancy phase, there is little developmental support for creating and designing VR games in Unity. The setup process highlights this,
				as the package installation process requires multiple packages to be installed, correct build settings to be applied, and troubleshooting unchanged
				script issues.

				After Setting up the fundamentals, the rest of the VR development went smoothly with minimal issues. Below you can find some of the
